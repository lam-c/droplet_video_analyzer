To access the downloaded data, please see the "data" folder.

This README file contains all associated metadata for the dataset and a description
of the files packaged with the data export.


==DATA EXPORT==

All data packages exported from the Duke Research Data Repository (RDR) will be arranged
according to the Library of Congress BagIt specification for disk-based
storage and network transfer of digital content.

A "bag" consists of a "payload" (the content) and "tags", which are metadata files
intended to document the storage and transfer of the bag. Data packages downloaded
from the RDR will contain:

  - a "data" directory that contains the files and content associated with the dataset

  - a "bag-info.txt" file which details metadata for the bag, including the date
  the bag was compiled

  - a "bagit.txt" file that identifies the directory as a bag, the version of the
  BagIt specification that it adheres to, and the character encoding used for tag files

  - 2 manifest files that itemize the files in the "data" directory along with their
  checksums--"manifest-md5.txt" lists checksums calculated with the MD5 algorithm,
  "manifest-sha1.txt" lists checksums calculated using the SHA-1 algorithm

  - 2 tag manifest files, which list checksums for the tag files enumerated above

Description: Mandates for mask use in public during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, worsened by global shortage of commercial supplies, have led to widespread use of homemade masks and mask alternatives. It is assumed that wearing such masks reduces the likelihood for an infected person to spread the disease, but many of these mask designs have not been tested in practice. We have applied a simple optical measurement method to evaluate the efficacy of masks to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech. We compare a variety of commonly available mask types and observe that some mask types approach the performance of standard surgical masks, while some mask alternatives, such as neck fleece or bandanas, offer very little protection. Our measurement setup is inexpensive and can be built and operated by non-experts, allowing for rapid evaluation of mask performance during speech, sneezing, or coughing.
